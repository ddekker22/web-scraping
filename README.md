# web-scraping

This challenge scrapes data from an online source using Splinter and BeautifulSoup. The majority of the tools needed to complete this project were provided from materials within the course; however, I used StackOverflow to review documentation on matplotlib in regards to plotting figures and bar charts. I also used Pandas documentation to understand how to convert to different data types, including int64 compared to the standard output of int32 using the "int" syntax. 

A csv of the mars temperature dataframe was included in the main branch as "mars_temp_csv.csv".
The first part of this module was completed under part_1_mars_news.ipynb.
The second part of this module was completed under part_2_mars_weather.ipynb.
